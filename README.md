# Algorithms

This repository contains many basic algorithms coded in C/C++.

Many more algorithms will be updated here.

#### Note
    In some IDE of C/C++, it will not detect few libraries like "algorithm.h" and "bits/stdc++.h". In that case, 
    change the extension of the files from .c to .cpp
    
    Also, in linux, to run C/C++ files with "math.h", add -lm while executing. Eg. g++/gcc <filename>.c -lm
